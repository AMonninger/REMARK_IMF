    "# Diving into HARK\n",
    "So far, we have seen how to use HARK and solve a basic consumer with a consumption-savings problem. We also saw, how we can exploit the Sequence Space Jacobian package to add the New Keynesian part of a HANK model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we want to dive more into HARK. We learn how the `Market`-Class works to solve for a Krusell Smith Model and highlight two different `AgentTypes` which can enrich the economic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We will look at some Demonstrations using Econ ARK (DemARK) and Repliactions (REMARK). The former need to be cloned from Github\n",

    "git clone https://Github.com/econ-ark/DemARK\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter has it's own python files and dependencies. Have a look at the requirements and readme file to make sure it runs smoothly."
