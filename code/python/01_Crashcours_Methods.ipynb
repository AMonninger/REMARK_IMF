    "## Mathematical background\n",
    "With the introduction of (non-trivial) risk, the idiosyncratic income shocks model has no closed form solution and must be solved numerically.  The function `solveConsIndShock` solves the one period problem for the `IndShockConsumerType` class.  To do so, HARK uses the original version of the endogenous grid method (EGM) first described [here](https://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/EndogenousGridpoints.pdf); see also the [SolvingMicroDSOPs](https://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/SolvingMicroDSOPs/) lecture notes. <!--- <cite data-cite=\"6202365/HQ6H9JEI\"></cite> -->\n",
